          <p>Have your guys heard about the term LGBTQ？ It’s definitely a serious topic in question. However,as far as my first touching related to this topic be concerned,I remembered that there was a really popular novel among my classmates called Call me by your name when I was in grade 6. I had a great curiosity and wanted to give it a go. As I insisted on buying it and shared it with my mom, she reacted abnormally gravely and shouted: “Over my dead body!” The reason was simply because she thought being a member of LGBTQ community didn’t fit her ethics, and she was worried about my understanding of the values of life. I felt extremely her concern was incomprehensible, after all, I knew the general meaning of LGBTQ. Meanwhile, I certainly didn’t become the so called “that kind of people” my mom imagined anyway.</p>

          <p>11月14日<br>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?<br>It is important for the government to provide money for beautiful things and not just for<br>practical things.<br>Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<p>Whether it is indispensable for the government to provide money for fanciable things and not just for utility things have been debating for several decades, a large majority of critics insist that mere practical infrastructure are crucial, however, I hold the thoroughly opposite perspective.</p>
<p>To begin with, It is irreplaceable that to construct a great deal of elegant ornamentation,especially the garden,mainly due to the fact that not only it can systematic glorify our metropolis to impel it to flatter a epitome in the municipal community, but also purify the air within the adjacent area, additionally, furnish a sense of cozy among the citizens to embellish a sort of delight in the hustle and bustle atmosphere. Given that the government dent to supervise several labors to frame the garden at the central city, as they are commanded to transplant a wide variety of categories of the vegetation, such as asters , Kikyo, Aubrieta ,pine,spruce in the garden, excavate a tremendous crack in order to form the pound when water is virtually injected, furthermore,open up some gravel paths as well as proliferate diverse uncompressed facilities.,when the flora is going to blossom as well as grow,the lake initiates to ripple with the sequential ting light,these spectacular scenes and decorations emerge a feeling of relaxation as the dwellers appreciate them,beside, the people can harvest the unrestrained consciousness when they are utilizing the playground equipment, thus, it is conducive for them to release the huge pressure and inhibit the depression arising.</p>
<p>Furthermore, establishing the glamorous museum is absolutely indispensable when it comes to enhance distinct types of aspects of the city , firstly, ascending the esteem for the artist and the quality of aesthetic, which can render consumers a deeper understanding of the art and broaden their horizon thoroughly when they enjoy the ingenious artifacts,on the other hand ,listen the introduction related to the striking antique with guide.Aside from that it can propel the culture communication between the diversity of countries and replenish the severe civilization divergence to boost city gradually evolves to a  comprehensive and international region with prolific unique elements. In addition, elaborating the whole metropolis to elicit more tourists, under such circumstance, enlarging the configuration and the reputation throughout the world, consequently, the escalation of thrive tourism will facilitate the economy prosperity, owing to the monstrous profits from the tickets of museum, government can also exploit the fabulous money dedicated in the technology development,accordingly, the technique will transform sophisticated progressively.</p>

          <p>Whether it is indispensable to learn a subject that has no direct connection with your major course of study or volunteer to work on a project in the university or the city to improve the life of the city is a controversial trendy over the past few years. A large majority of people believe that engaging  a distinct subject could be a better decision, ;nonetheless, I oppose this perspective thoroughly.</p>
<p>To begin with, it is beneficial for the studentswhen it comes to. participating in a specific voluntary job for the impelling development or enhancing conservation of the metropolis.Mainly due to the fact that{the first convincing reason is that}  during the working, the students could attempt novel issues or events which they may not encounter before. For instance,guiding the customer within municipal museum to bringing them the historical information relating to the antiquated culture precipitation , ; meanwhile,taking part in educational administration for the purpose of aiding teenagers associated with their academics and so forth.  Under such circumstance, not only could it augment the average life quality between the citizens  accumulating divergency divergent experiences for the charitable students in the daily basis. Consequently, laying a solid foundation for their future occupation as well as PHD degrees is destined to be realized. Moreover, they will certainly gain a great deal of comprehensible flair in the process of operating a project; to be specific, as they are collecting rubbish to the garbage and maintenance the useless infrastructure in the garden, they will need to seek a wide variety of skills, such as cooperation and communication ability which relating to the approach of how to work with unfamiliar so-call co-workers. In this case, ascending different skills for the students will definitely be conducive in the independent living</p>
<p>Secondly, what should not be prioritized is to select an irrelevant subject. Above all, as the students in the campus, they immerse in the tons of paper as well essays undoubtedly even in this summer vacation, in this case, learning a completely unrelated course will distract the students from concentrating on the compulsory major. Additionally, diminishing the efficiency of learning can’t be overlooked. The alternative proper reason is that they have already struggled with numerous pressure from the university credits or homework. If they prone to gain another “useless” subjects , they will not accustom to the bustle time template and distributed unfamiliar knowledge which strongly leading to the overwhelming depression, such as trauma relating to mental disease.</p>
<p>In conclusion, above-mentioned reasons can well illustrate my perspective that it is vital to volunteer project rather than study an irrelevant course.</p>
